Gondor-Base
==========

Easy way to start a Gondor-based project is to fork or clone this empty one.  See for example Gondor-Test.

The steps to initialize a working directory with this project:

```
git clone git@github.com:jimwhite/gondor-base.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Where the repo url has been forked & renamed appropriately, although you can do that afterwards too of course.

Since a Gondor-based project is expected to retain the execution memos for some application, I expect you'll add one or more submodules for your application code and data.
